    question: "What is the most cost-effective purchasing option for running a set of EC2 instances that must always be available for a period of two months?",
    answers: [
      { definition: "A. On-Demand Instances.", details: "For running EC2 instances that must always be available for two months, On-Demand Instances are the most cost-effective option, as they provide the necessary flexibility and do not require long-term commitments." },
      { definition: "B. Spot Instances.", details: "Spot Instances are often the most cost-effective option but are not suitable for workloads that must always be available, as they can be interrupted if the spot price exceeds your bid." },
      { definition: "C. Reserved Instances - All Upfront.", details: "While Reserved Instances can provide significant savings for long-term usage (1 or 3 years), they require a commitment that doesn't align with a short-term need of two months." },
      { definition: "D. Reserved Instances - No Upfront.", details: "Similar to the All Upfront option, Reserved Instances generally require a commitment of one year or more, making them less suitable for a two-month requirement." },
    ],
    correct: "A. On-Demand Instances."

    question: "Which of the following is a benefit of running an application in multiple Availability Zones?",
    answers: [
      { definition: "A. Allows you to exceed AWS service limits.", details: "This statement is incorrect. Running in multiple AZs does not allow you to exceed AWS service limits, as those limits are defined per account regardless of the number of AZs used." },
      { definition: "B. Reduces application response time between servers and global users.", details: "While using multiple AZs can improve availability, it does not inherently reduce response time for global users. Response time can be affected by the geographic distance between users and the nearest AZ." },
      { definition: "C. Increases available compute capacity.", details: "While multiple AZs can allow you to scale your application, the primary benefit is not about increasing compute capacity but rather about providing high availability." },
      { definition: "D. Increases the availability of your application.", details: "The main benefit of running an application in multiple Availability Zones is that it increases the availability of your application, ensuring it remains operational even in the event of an AZ failure." },
    ],
    correct: "D. Increases the availability of your application."

    question: "Data security is one of the top priorities of AWS. How does AWS deal with old storage devices that have reached the end of their useful life?",
    answers: [
      { definition: "A. AWS sells the old devices to other hosting providers.", details: "This is not true, as selling old devices could pose a security risk by potentially exposing customer data." },
      { definition: "B. AWS destroys the old devices in accordance with industry-standard practices.", details: "AWS ensures the security of customer data by destroying old storage devices in compliance with industry-standard practices, preventing any risk of data recovery." },
      { definition: "C. AWS sends the old devices for remanufacturing.", details: "This option is incorrect, as the focus is on secure destruction rather than remanufacturing to ensure data is not recoverable." },
      { definition: "D. AWS stores the old devices in a secure place.", details: "While secure storage may be appropriate for some assets, old storage devices that have reached the end of their useful life are destroyed to prevent any data exposure." },
    ],
    correct: "B. AWS destroys the old devices in accordance with industry-standard practices."
